I figured it was finally the time to host some of my content online for sharing,
fun, persistence, easy access and all the other usual suspects. Going into this
adventure there were only a few requirements that I wanted my website to meet:

- Content should be written in my favorite [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][text editor]] with [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]].
- No need for any back-end or front-end logic: serving a static website without
  any fancy HTML/CSS/JS shenanigans will be more than fine.
- The website should be standalone so that it can be viewed offline as well.
- Convenient hosting: hustling with administrating a web-server for such a small
  project would not make any sense to me.

Let me explain. I have been using Emacs and Org mode for several years now. Its
markup language really fits my needs and the files integrate well with the
agenda and other nifty features Org mode has to offer. The ability to hack its
behavior directly in elisp is also a great plus to me. This is why I searched
for options that would allow me to use my Org content without too much trouble.

When it comes to this website, I want to be able to turn what I am currently
working on into publishable content without having to spend extra time on
re-formatting my writing completely. It was thus pretty obvious that I would
give a try to the built-in [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][org-publish]] package for Emacs as it is exactly what I
am looking for: automated and configurable exporting of Org projects to simple
HTML files. There a few other projects which turn a collection of Org files into
a website, such as [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog][org-static-blog]], but I figured I would like to have maximal
control over the toolchain and keep external dependencies as low as possible.

Using git versioning gives me the opportunity to track and manage changes over
time. Since we are dealing with a static website with exclusively public data,
[[https://github.io][github.io]] will handle the hosting for me. Whenever I work on a new item, I can
pull the remote github repository, create a local branch and start editing. When
the content is ready for publishing, the branch is merged into main, pushed to
the remote github repository and /voil√†/!

I ended up with something like the following directory structure for this
project. The github repository containing all the source files can be found
[[https://github.com/fuzztheplanet/fuzztheplanet.github.io][here]].

#+begin_example
- ~/org/blog/
  - files/
    - css/
    - fonts/
    - img/
  - src/
    - index.org
    - about.org
    - posts/
      - hello.org
      - super-dupa-post.org
  - templates/
    - header.html
    - footer.html
    - post.org
    - readthedocs.org
  - Makefile
  - publish-website.el
  - README.org
#+end_example

*src/* contains the standalone Org files that will be published to HTML. They
are declaring as few exporting options as possible so that they can easily be
used in other contexts or projects. Global exporting options will be defined in
*publish-website.el* and page specific options provided via templates or
directly in the files themselves. The *files/* and *templates/* directories host
assets such as stylesheets, fonts, images, etc. that are specific to the HTML
export.

The logic behind publishing is implemented in *publish-website.el* which is
then called by a *Makefile* for convenience. It defines all the directories,
files and exporting options to be fed into /org-publish/. I could have written
*publish-website.el* in literate programming style and use it as source for this
blog post, but that would have been a little bit too meta, even for me :)

Finally, *README.org* is just a symbolic link to *src/about.org*. Why? Because I
can.

* To the first page!

Global exporting options are defined in *publish-website.el* which can be
overridden by the definitions in the single Org files. When several Org files
share the same defaults, it can make sense to define them in an Org template
file and use the =#+SETUPFILE: ../templates/mytemplate.org= directive in the
relevant source files. =#+INCLUDE: <path/to/file.org>= can also be used, its
content will then plainly be inserted in the source file before processing.

This is for example the beginning of this post. I set the title, the date, I
include a template and insert a preview. More on all this a little bit later.

Appending a =CUSTOM_ID= property to headlines makes it possible to link to the
specific headline in the table of contents and HTML.

*** Templates

Template are used to group seveal Org rendering and exporting that are common to
several files. For example, the template under *templates/post.org* looks like
this:

#+begin_src org
@@html:<div class="post-date">@@
/First published: {{{date(%d %b %Y)}}}/
@@html:</div>@@
#+end_src

The /date/ tag of the post will be extracted and added to the HTML during
publishing.

Here is a template for the [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes?tab=readme-ov-file#readtheorg][ReadTheOrg]] theme by [[https://github.com/fniessen][Fabrice Niessen]] that inserts HTML
into any page published with it:

#+begin_src org
,#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/files/css/readtheorg/readtheorg.css"/>

The two files that are used are *files/css/style.css* and
*files/css/htmlize.css*. In *style.css* are all the base styles for the pages
defined. Since I am aiming for a small and flexible website I decided to write
my own CSS manually (and I suck at it tbh). People who don't want to enjoy the
same +painful+ wonderful experience should try to look for pre-existing
stylesheets and exporting options. *htmlize.css* is used to pretty source code
blocks.

It was hyped for long enough, here is the [[https://github.com/fuzztheplanet/fuzztheplanet.github.io/blob/main/publish-website.el][publish-website.el]] file. This file
defines common settings and build instructions for the project. We feed them
into /org-publish/ which will take care of producing the corresponding website.

The file is pretty simple and self-explanatory. I mostly added the following
functions to generate a "preview" of each post, which will be visible in the
[[./index.org][list of all posts]], as well as include a formatted timestamp of when the post was
first added. A custom macro is used to format the timestamp. The content of the
"preview" is written in between the custom =#+begin_preview= and =#+end_preview=
tags.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Extract content between #+begin_preview and #+end_preview
(defun skw-blog/get-preview (file)
  "The comments (begin/end_preview) in'file' have to be on their own lines,
   preferably before and after paragraphs."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (message file)
    (insert-file-contents file)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let ((beg (+ 1 (re-search-forward "^#\\+begin_preview$")))
          (end (progn (re-search-forward "^#\\+end_preview$")
                      (match-beginning 0))))
      (replace-regexp-in-string "\n" " " (buffer-substring beg end)))))


;; Format list of blog post for the sitemap / index
(defun skw-blog/org-format-blog-post (entry style project)
  "Format 'entry' in org-publish 'project' sitemap to include a timestamp."
  (let ((entry-title (org-publish-find-title entry project)))
    (if (= (length entry-title) 0)
        (format "*%s*" entry)
      (format "{{{timestamp(%s)}}}: [[file:%s][%s]]"
              (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d" (org-publish-find-date entry project))
              entry
              entry-title))))


;; Same but add the content between the "preview" tags
(defun skw-blog/org-format-blog-post-with-preview (entry style project)
  "Format 'entry' in org-publish 'project' sitemap to include a timestamp
   and preview ('begin/end_preview' tag)."
  (let ((entry-title (org-publish-find-title entry project))
        (preview (skw-blog/get-preview (concat (skw-blog/get-root-directory) "src/posts/" entry)))) ;; dirty
    (if (= (length entry-title) 0)
        (format "*%s*" entry)
      (format "{{{timestamp(%s)}}}: [[file:%s][%s]]\n
%s"
              (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d" (org-publish-find-date entry project))
              entry
              entry-title
              preview))))


;; Exporting macros
(setq org-export-global-macros
      '(("timestamp" . "@@html:<span class=\"timestamp\">$1</span>@@")))
#+end_src

The corresponding publishing rules then look like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

The generated *./src/posts/index-no-description.org* is inserted into the
homepage with:

#+begin_src org
,#+INCLUDE: "./posts/index-no-description.org" :lines "3-7"
#+end_src

Let's use *make* to avoid building and managing the website by hand.

#+begin_src makefile
OUT_DIR='www'
PUBLISH_FILE='publish-website.el'
PUBLISH_FUNC='(org-publish "website")'
WS_CMD=python -m http.server 12345 --bind localhost --directory $(OUT_DIR)

all:
    rm -rf .cache www
    emacs -Q --batch --load $(PUBLISH_FILE) --eval $(PUBLISH_FUNC)
    rm -rf .cache

mathjax:
    rm -rf files/js/mathjax
    git clone https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax.git files/js/mathjax
    rm -rf files/js/mathjax/.git

publish:
    git commit
    git push -u origin main

update:
    make all
    make mathjax
    git add .
    git status

run:
    $(WS_CMD)

.PHONY: all mathjax publish update run
#+end_src

Whenever I want to work on a new item, like adding a new file or editing an
existing one, I switch to a new local branch. I then simply run =make=
periodically while editing to visualize my changes. When I am done I merge the
branch into my local main branch and run =make update= to verify what will be
committed and then =make publish= to push the changes on the remote repository.
Cherry on top, =make run= spawns a python web-server to view the website locally
at http://localhost:12345.

[[https://www.mathjax.org/][MathJax]]' [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Math-formatting-in-HTML-export.html][Org mode support]] lets me export to HTML math formulas written in LaTeX.
Here are a couple of examples using inline code blocks and "proper" LaTeX
syntax.

#+begin_src org
If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or
\[ a=-\sqrt{2} \]

Look at this lonely equation I found:

\begin{equation}
y = x^2+1
\end{equation}

Which will be rendered like this:

I install and update regularly /MathJax/ via the *Makefile* and then enable it
in *publish-website.el* via the =org-html-mathjax-options= variable. Since I
want to be able to view the website offline, I opted for a local install.

#+begin_src makefile

Generating a RSS to track when new posts are published is actually not that
complicated with [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/ox-rss][ox-rss]]. Here are a couple of helper functions to generate a
"sitemap" file named *rss.org* which will list all the entries under
*src/posts/* excluding the previously generated indexes. This file is then
converted to XML. The description field of each item is the content of the
=preview= tags used earlier.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; RSS feed generation
(defun skw-blog/publish-to-rss (plist filename dir)
  "Publish 'plist' when 'filename' corresponds to RSS feed Org-file to 'dir'."

      (org-rss-publish-to-rss plist filename dir)))

(defun skw-blog/format-rss-feed (title list)
  "Generate a sitemap of posts that will be exported as a RSS feed. 'title' is
title of the RSS feed and 'list' the files to be included."
  (concat "#+TITLE: " title "\n\n" (org-list-to-subtree list)))

(defun skw-blog/format-rss-feed-entry (entry style project)
  "Format 'entry' for the posts RSS feed in given 'project'."
  (let* ((title (org-publish-find-title entry project))
         (link (concat (file-name-sans-extension entry) ".html"))
         (pubdate (format-time-string (car org-time-stamp-formats)

    (format "%s

This publishing setup is quite rudimentary. I wrote this note mostly for self
reference in case I have to implement a similar project in the future. However,
I still hope it can help hesitating people to give a try to /org-publish/ and
see if it fits their needs. Maybe existing users could also get a tip or two out
of this. The full code is available on my [[https://github.com/fuzztheplanet/fuzztheplanet.github.io][github]].

I would encourage anyone fiddling with this to have the official documentation
right at hand:

- [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]]
- [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][Org-publish]]
- [[https://orgmode.org/worg/][Worg]]

Here are websites that inspired me for this adventure. I highly recommend that
you check them out as well as their publishing workflow:

- [[https://www.taingram.org/blog/org-mode-blog.html][Building a Emacs Org-Mode Blog]] by [[https://www.taingram.org/][Thomas Ingram]] showcases a simple yet
  effective setup.
- [[https://ogbe.net/blog/blogging_with_org.html][Blogging using org-mode (and nothing else)]] by [[https://ogbe.net/][Dennis Ogbe]] is a really neat
  explanations and setup with Org-file pre-processing before publishing.
- [[https://ryuslash.org/literate-build.html][A literate programming example]] by [[https://ryuslash.org/][ryuslash]].
