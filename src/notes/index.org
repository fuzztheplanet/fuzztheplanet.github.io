[[./rtfsg/][Red Team Field Survival Guide]] is my personal note collection about anything
related to offensive security. It contains tips and tricks gathered along the

scenarios. Links to more in-depth and exhaustive resources are provided as much
as possible. *Warning:* this section is by no means exhaustive and lots of tips
here might be outdated or not fully accurate.
