#+TITLE: Welcome to my little patch of internet!

This blog is intended to host my personal content. I write about topics that I
enjoy or that I curse, which might or might not be related to information
security, programming, /crÃªpes au sucre/ and UNIX-based systems. You get the
idea... Oh and, disclaimer, I can also be pretty offensive.

If I occasionally write something for a punctual, one-of topic, it will be
published as a [[./posts/][blog post]]. The [[./notes/][notes]] section points toward more lengthy content
that might get updated over time. Resources that were particularly useful and
interesting to me are kept in the [[./links.org][links]] section. Information about this website
and my contact details can be found in the [[./about.org][about]] page. What is currently on my
mind is on my [[./now.org][now]] page.

With this out of the way, I wish you happy reading!
