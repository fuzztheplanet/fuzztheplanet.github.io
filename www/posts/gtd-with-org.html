<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-rationale">
<p>
I won't talk too much about the added values of "Getting Things Done" (GTD) and
other organization/productivity enforcement strategies as there already exists
plenty of literature about such topics. Everyone has their own personal needs,
ways to organize themselves, yaddi yaddi yadda, you know the drill. So I will
just highlight the benefits that I <i>personally</i> draw out of using a GTD
"system":
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Increased efficiency</b>: Tasks are clearly defined, prioritized and
categorized. They contain enough information to get started immediately
without losing too much time and risking getting distracted in the process.
While planning ahead, it is easy to determine which actions have to be taken
and avoid the unnecessary idle time spent ordering all the items mentally to
figure out what to do next.</li>

<li><b>Clear mind</b>: Important tasks are written down and saved on a device which
saves the mental charge of having to remember them. This helps reducing the,
sometimes unconscious, stress and anxiety. Clearing the back of my mind from
non-important noise allows me to be more committed and focused on the current
matter.</li>

<li><b>Tracking</b>: There is a record of the most important things that happened. This
record can be searched through in order to look up something specific or just
to see how some things evolved over longer periods of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
By GTD "system" I mean any device, digital or physical, that is used to track
down the progress of one's tasks, goals, projects, notes and so on. I chose to
implement mine with Emacs' <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a>. Not only does it integrate well with my
existing setup as I use it already for its markup language, the "system" also
only consists of good old plain text files. This ensures me that I will still be
able to work with it in 37 years, somehow, even after the second zombie
apocalypse nearly killed us all. It can also pretty easily be
version-controlled, backed-up and encrypted (for which I use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, <a href="http://duplicity.nongnu.org/">duplicity</a> and
<a href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> respectively).
</p>

<p>
The rest of this post will describe how these functionalities can be implemented
with Org. The Elisp code shown is complete and can easily be reused and
personalized. It also reflects the overall approach that I had: just roll-out a
simple functional system and then organically adapt it to fit the desired
requirements and workflows. Most of it is directly taken from the sources
mentioned <a href="#resources">below</a> or from the <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/">Org manual</a>. I highly recommend you check them out!

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow Overview</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-workflow">
<p>
The most central piece is certainly my custom <i>agenda view</i>. At the top is a
calender displaying scheduled tasks and upcoming deadlines for the next 14 days.
Underneath is a list of on-going and pending tasks, sorted by status, priority
and effort estimate. I keep this view constantly open and update the tasks from
there as I work on them.
</p>

<p>
Each task can be given a TODO status, several tags, a priority and an effort
estimate. The agenda view makes it very convenient to filter the tasks according
to these properties. Thus I can easily switch from an exhaustive listing of all
tasks to a more focused view of what currently matters to me. From the agenda
view it is also quite straightforward to change a task's status, reschedule it
or add notes to it. If new tasks, appointments or ideas arise, they can quickly
be added to my <i>inbox</i> with <i>org-capture</i> from anywhere within Emacs.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, I try to take 5-10 minutes to clean-up my <i>inbox</i>. I add
more information to the tasks or notes that came in and refile them to the
relevant Org files. I use this time to go through my todos, adjust priorities
and (re)schedule items <i>when it makes sense</i>.
</p>

<p>
I perform a monthly review of all my Org files. I check the logs and archive
completed tasks. I go through each file and check whether notes can be turned
into tasks or vice versa. I also review my short-term goals and reorganize my
todos if needed.
</p>

<p>
Overall, I try to keep my agenda and todos to a minimal. I only create tasks
from things that I actually <i>have to</i> do. For the rest, I rather take notes and
consult them whenever it's relevant. Furthermore, I am not a big fan of
overplanning. I only schedule tasks and assign deadlines when it's absolutely
necessary, when exterior circumstances force me to it (appointments,
administrative deadlines, etc.). I prefer to carry around a small list of todos
(if I run out of tasks I know where to find more, don't worry about me..) rather
than a huge backlog of tasks that is hidden from me because the tasks are
scheduled for the future without any solid justification.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Don't overload your agenda with tasks, don't overload tasks with details, don't
mix tasks and notes - that's basically it.

I use two setups across my workstations: one dedicated to personal things while
the other is for work. Those two setups are nearly identical so I will just
present how I use the personal one in the rest of this post (this is why
everything is prefixed with <i>perso</i> or <i>p</i>).

<p>
For my usage, a project is simply a collection of tasks and/or notes related to
a topic. For example I have a project for this blog, another one where I store
my recipes, &#x2026; You get the idea. Each project has its own file. My general,
day-to-day activities like appointments, chores and other todos are stored in
<b>perso.org</b>.
</p>

<p>
Completed tasks from my main file, <b>perso.org</b>, are archived in
<b>archives/logbooks/logbook.org</b> in <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-elements.html#FOOT84">datetree format</a>. Tasks from projects are
archived in their own file under <b>archives/projects/project_A.org</b>.
</p>

<p>
My configuration file is actually the present file, <b>conf.org</b>, that you are
currently reading. I use literate programming to document my configuration in
the form of an Org file. Every code block with the tag <code>:tangle yes</code> will be
exported and evaluated thanks to <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html">org-babel</a>.

A task has 5 possible states:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>TODO</code> for when the task has not been started yet.</li>
<li><code>CURR</code> and <code>STOP</code> for tasks that are either already in progress or on hold.</li>
<li><code>DONE</code> and <code>ABRT</code> for fully completed or aborted tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is a pretty basic classification but I don't really need more. Having this
separation allows me to filter tasks quickly in <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html">agenda views</a> (<code>/</code>) or <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Sparse-Trees.html">sparse
trees</a> (<code>C-c /</code>). I define another sequence with <code>MEET</code>, <code>DONE</code> or <code>ABRT</code> to
handle appointments. The reason why I have a separate status keyword is that I
want to be able to track them very carefully so that I don't overlook them. Most
of my <code>TODO</code> items could be rescheduled if I somehow cannot work on them. This
is not the case for <code>MEET</code> items.

<p>
I don't use the <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Clocking-Work-Time.html">clocking</a> functionality as I haven't identified a proper need for
it in my workflow (yet) but I tend to make heavy use of modifiers (<code>@</code> and <code>!</code>)
to track when a state change occurred and sometimes add a note to it. I often
document the current status on important todos for when I will resuming the
tasks. Additionally, I like to log every state change as the timeline can be
valuable information while reviewing the task. They can always be deleted before
archiving the task anyway.
</p>

<p>
Tasks are items that are quite straightforward and can be completed in one go.
For more complex tasks with dependencies, I use nested todos. This hook switches
a <code>TODO</code> heading to <code>DONE</code> when all its subheadings (i.e. subtasks) are marked
as <code>DONE</code>.

Tags add more context to a task. They are used to perform additional sorting and
filtering with <i>agenda views</i> or <i>sparse trees</i>. The following are global tags
that can possibly apply across all my Org files.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

With single key selection, hitting <code>C-c C-C</code> on an item will display a prompt in
the minibuffer. From there, pressing the hotkey listed above will assign the
corresponding tag, <code>space</code> will clear the current tags and &lt;tab&gt; will prompt for
a tag, showing the pre-existing tags through completion. I use this feature
quite a lot to mark tasks as <code>@URGENT</code> or <code>@REFILE</code> on-the-fly and have them pop
on top of my priority list in the agenda view.

<p>
Filetags can be added per file via the directive <code>#+FILETAGS: &lt;tag&gt;</code>. Every
single heading of the file will inherit the tag. Every Org file is assigned such
filetags to facilitate differentiating between personal items and work items. If
I find the need for it, I add some additional tags on a per-file-basis manually.

Tasks are assigned one of 3 priorities: <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>. Priorities are always
relative to each other <i>within</i> a project, never <i>across</i> projects. Tasks with
priority <code>A</code> should be ideally completed before anything else. Then it would be
the turn of <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> (aka "whenever") tasks. A better looking font-face is
assigned to different priorities with the package <a href="https://github.com/harrybournis/org-fancy-priorities">org-fancy-priorities</a>.

<p>
With <i>priority commands</i> enabled, it's possible to shift a priority of an item
with <code>S-Up</code> and <code>S-Down</code> from the agenda view or with the cursor on the heading.

<p>
Whenever possible, I use <code>C-c C-x e</code> (or <code>e</code> in the agenda view) to set <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Effort-Estimates.html">effort
estimates</a> on a todo. Knowing how long a task would approximately take is useful
when I need to plan my day. For that I follow my rule of thumb: I take the
amount of time that I <i>guess</i> a task would take and multiply it by 2.
</p>

<p>
The property is somehow not in uppercase like most of the others, let's fix it.

</pre>
</div>

<p>
In the end, the combination of priority and effort estimate are mostly used to
provide a sorting strategy in the agenda views. In my case, I often know
on-the-spot which tasks should be tackled first so I don't need to rely on them
too heavily.

Here are the keybindings that I use the most within the agenda view (taken from
<a href="https://blog.aaronbieber.com/2016/09/25/agenda-interactions-primer.html">Aaron Bieber</a>):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To navigate the agenda:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>: Opens the selected entry in a new split window and jumps to it.</li>
<li><code>&lt;enter&gt;</code>: Same but opens in the current window.</li>
<li><code>S-f</code>: Activate "follow mode". This opens a new split window to show the
selected entry with a highlight, but focus stays on the agenda view. I find it
quite useful so that I always have more context on the entry that I'm
currently viewing, without leaving the agenda view. If I really need to jump
to the item, I press <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><code>sg</code>: Save the agenda files and rebuild the agenda view. I end up hitting that
quite a lot out of reflex.</li>
<li><code>/</code>: Prompt for a match (category, tag, regex, &#x2026;).</li>
<li><code>v A</code>: Include archived entries.</li>
<li><code>v L</code>: Toggle log mode.</li>
<li><code>&lt;</code>: Focus the agenda view on the current category. Extremely useful.</li>
<li><code>v E</code>: Add additional context on tasks when possible.</li>
<li><code>K</code>: Toggle the display of habits.</li>
<li><code>v &lt;space&gt;</code>: Reset the current view to org-agenda-span.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>To edit entries:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>C-c C-c</code>: Add a tag.</li>
<li><code>t</code>: Cycle the TODO state of an entry.</li>
<li><code>e</code> (or <code>C-c C-x e</code>): Set the effort on an entry.</li>
<li><code>z</code> (or <code>C-c C-z</code>): Add a note to the entry.</li>
<li><code>+</code> / <code>-</code> (or <code>S-up</code> / <code>S-down</code>): Increase / decrease the priority of an
entry.</li>
<li><code>S-left / S-right</code>: Shift the scheduled date or deadline of an entry.</li>
<li><code>C-c C-w</code>: Refile an entry.</li>
<li><code>$</code> (or <code>C-c C-x C-s</code>): Archive entry (subtree) to it's corresponding
archive file.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Adding items to the system is done with org-capture. Pressing <code>C-c c</code> anywhere
in Emacs will bring up custom capture templates, prompt for minimal information
and close itself, allowing me to continue doing my previous task where I left it
off.
</p>

<p>
Everything I capture goes to my <b>inbox.org</b> file for later refiling and
processing, except journal entries which get inserted in datetree format in
<b>journal.org</b>. The templates are pretty self-explaining, the documentation is
available <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html">here</a>.

<p>
When a task has been completed or canceled for a while, I don't want to have it
on the radar anymore so I <a href="https://orgmode.org/guide/Archiving.html">archive</a> it away. Items from <b>perso.org</b> go into
<b>archives/logbooks/logbook.org_archive</b> in <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-elements.html#FOOT84">datetree</a> format and those from
projects go to <b>archives/projects/&lt;project.org&gt;</b>. Hitting <code>C-c $</code> on a heading
or <code>$</code> on the agenda view will archive the item to the correct location.
</p>

<p>
From the agenda view, when I want to inspect archived items, I can press <code>v A l</code>
(or <code>v A v L</code> for a more exhaustive view, with state changes) to add them to the
agenda and then reduce I often reduce the view to a single category with <code>&lt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
Locations are defined using the following in-buffer directives:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name"><span class="listing-number">Listing 25: </span>conf.org</label><pre class="src src-org"><span class="org-org-meta-line">#+ARCHIVE: ./archives/logbooks/logbook.org_archive::datetree/</span>

</pre>
</div>

<p>
When archiving, I want to preserve the TODO state, keep existing tags and add
some context. Lastly, I want to save the file after adding an archived item and
still be able to cycle through tree tagged with <code>:ARCHIVE:</code>.
